# Interpreter for the Monkey programming language

This repo, is based off the Thorsten Ball's book, Writing an Interpreter in Go. Eventually, this will be archived and the code will be moved to [Playground](github.com/saikrishamohan7/Playground).

## Motivation

- Understand how interpreters work
  - All my professional life I have worked with JS, an interpreted language. This endeavor is to explore this part of computer science.

## Required software to run this project

- Any Go version over 1.7 (I am using 1.24)

## Where can this knowledge be applied?

I am thinking of writing a model checker and a parser for TLA+ (Leslie Lamport, FTW).
